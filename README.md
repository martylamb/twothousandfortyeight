=====================

    ...
    
    Unsure how long you have been standing there, shocked at the grid's beauty,
    you notice the wrinkled face of an old man appearing through a dirty window.
    He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
    
    "I am the master of the grid, whose task it is to insure that none
    but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers waste their time here.
    You appear to be neither... but whatever."
            
    "You must combine grid tiles to create one with the number 2048 on it."
    
    ....

Twothousandfortyeight is a text adventure version of the game [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

It listens for telnet connections on port 2048 and can built and launched via the command "**mvn compile exec:java**".

To play, use "**telnet HOSTNAME 2048**", where HOSTNAME is the name or IP of the machine it's running on.
